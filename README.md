## Hi, I'm Ivan 👋😎

I'm a passionate Fullstack Developer with a UX/UI soul. 
I'm a firm believer in continuous learning. I love exploring new technologies, 
experimenting with different approaches, and constantly challenging myself to improve my skills.

Despite being a junior, I bring new ideas and creative solutions to each project.

  pronouns: "he" ! "him",
  code: [Javascript, HTML, CSS],
  tools: [React, React Native, Node, Docker],
  learning: [Angular, Typescript]
